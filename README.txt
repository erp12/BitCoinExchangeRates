This was created as a final project for the Hampshire College Course, "Evolution of Artificial Intelligence."

-----

Just run GA.py to use PyEvolve and the Emergent Artificial 
Neural Network Simulator together to predict the price of 
bitcoins for the next hour based on data taken over the 
course of a past week.

-----

Sample data is already loaded into the system. To use new 
data, you must replace the training data and normalize it 
yourself. I would recommend this site:

This system uses PyEvolve library to handle the Genetic 
Algorithm. PyEvolve: http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/
